### About

Assigning right tags (title, author, album) to the MP3 files located inside specified folder.

### How It Works
The initital ideas is to assign the proper tags to the MP3 audio files in case most of the compositions are named in the following pattern
```
<AUTHOR>' '<DELIMETER-SUCH-AS-DASH>' '<TITLE>'
```
Non-standard names of the songs or artists can be handled by means of the *'artists.py'* file, just add the artist names to the list there.

### Dependencies
